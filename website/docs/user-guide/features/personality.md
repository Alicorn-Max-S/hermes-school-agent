# Personality & SOUL.md

Apollo Agent's personality is customizable, but there are two different layers that matter:

- `SOUL.md` — a durable persona file that lives in `APOLLO_HOME` and is loaded automatically for that Apollo instance
- built-in or custom `/personality` presets — session-level system-prompt overlays

If you want a stable default voice that follows you across sessions, `SOUL.md` is the right tool.

## How SOUL.md works now

Apollo now seeds a default `SOUL.md` automatically in:

```text
~/.apollo/SOUL.md
```

More precisely, it uses the current instance's `APOLLO_HOME`, so if you run Apollo with a custom home directory, it will use:

```text
$APOLLO_HOME/SOUL.md
```

### Important behavior

- Apollo creates a starter `SOUL.md` automatically if one does not exist yet
- Existing user `SOUL.md` files are never overwritten
- Apollo loads `SOUL.md` only from `APOLLO_HOME`
- Apollo does not look in the current working directory for `SOUL.md`
- If `SOUL.md` exists but is empty, Apollo adds nothing from it to the prompt
- If `SOUL.md` has content, that content is injected verbatim after security scanning and truncation
- Apollo does not add wrapper language like "If SOUL.md is present..." around the file anymore

That makes `SOUL.md` a true per-user or per-instance default personality, not a repo-local trick.

## Why this design

This keeps personality predictable.

If Apollo loaded `SOUL.md` from whatever directory you happened to launch it in, your personality could change unexpectedly between projects. By loading only from `APOLLO_HOME`, the personality belongs to the Apollo instance itself.

That also makes it easier to teach users:
- "Edit `~/.apollo/SOUL.md` to change Apollo's default personality."

## Where to edit it

For most users:

```bash
~/.apollo/SOUL.md
```

If you use a custom home:

```bash
$APOLLO_HOME/SOUL.md
```

## What should go in SOUL.md?

Use it for durable voice and personality guidance, such as:
- tone
- communication style
- level of directness
- default interaction style
- what to avoid stylistically
- how Apollo should handle uncertainty, disagreement, or ambiguity

Use it less for:
- one-off project instructions
- file paths
- repo conventions
- temporary workflow details

Those belong in `AGENTS.md`, not `SOUL.md`.

## Good SOUL.md content

A good SOUL file is:
- stable across contexts
- broad enough to apply in many conversations
- specific enough to materially shape the voice
- focused on communication and identity, not task-specific instructions

### Example

```markdown
# Personality

You are a pragmatic senior engineer with strong taste.
You optimize for truth, clarity, and usefulness over politeness theater.

## Style
- Be direct without being cold
- Prefer substance over filler
- Push back when something is a bad idea
- Admit uncertainty plainly
- Keep explanations compact unless depth is useful

## What to avoid
- Sycophancy
- Hype language
- Repeating the user's framing if it's wrong
- Overexplaining obvious things

## Technical posture
- Prefer simple systems over clever systems
- Care about operational reality, not idealized architecture
- Treat edge cases as part of the design, not cleanup
```

## What Apollo injects into the prompt

If `SOUL.md` contains text, Apollo injects the file's text itself — not a wrapper explanation.

So the system prompt gets the content directly, after:
- prompt-injection scanning
- truncation if it is too large

If the file is empty or whitespace-only, nothing from `SOUL.md` is added.

## Security scanning

`SOUL.md` is scanned like other context-bearing files for prompt injection patterns before inclusion.

That means you should still keep it focused on persona/voice rather than trying to sneak in strange meta-instructions.

## SOUL.md vs AGENTS.md

This is the most important distinction.

### SOUL.md
Use for:
- identity
- tone
- style
- communication defaults
- personality-level behavior

### AGENTS.md
Use for:
- project architecture
- coding conventions
- tool preferences
- repo-specific workflows
- commands, ports, paths, deployment notes

A useful rule:
- if it should follow you everywhere, it belongs in `SOUL.md`
- if it belongs to a project, it belongs in `AGENTS.md`

## SOUL.md vs `/personality`

`SOUL.md` is your durable default personality.

`/personality` is a session-level overlay that changes or supplements the current system prompt.

So:
- `SOUL.md` = baseline voice
- `/personality` = temporary mode switch

Examples:
- keep a pragmatic default SOUL, then use `/personality teacher` for a tutoring conversation
- keep a concise SOUL, then use `/personality creative` for brainstorming

## Built-in personalities

Apollo ships with built-in personalities you can switch to with `/personality`.

| Name | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **helpful** | Friendly, general-purpose assistant |
| **concise** | Brief, to-the-point responses |
| **technical** | Detailed, accurate technical expert |
| **creative** | Innovative, outside-the-box thinking |
| **teacher** | Patient educator with clear examples |
| **kawaii** | Cute expressions, sparkles, and enthusiasm ★ |
| **catgirl** | Neko-chan with cat-like expressions, nya~ |
| **pirate** | Captain Apollo, tech-savvy buccaneer |
| **shakespeare** | Bardic prose with dramatic flair |
| **surfer** | Totally chill bro vibes |
| **noir** | Hard-boiled detective narration |
| **uwu** | Maximum cute with uwu-speak |
| **philosopher** | Deep contemplation on every query |
| **hype** | MAXIMUM ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM!!! |

## Switching personalities with commands

### CLI

```text
/personality
/personality concise
/personality technical
```

### Messaging platforms

```text
/personality teacher
```

These are convenient overlays, but your global `SOUL.md` still gives Apollo its persistent default personality unless the overlay meaningfully changes it.

## Custom personalities in config

You can also define named custom personalities in `~/.apollo/config.yaml` under `agent.personalities`.

```yaml
agent:
  personalities:
    codereviewer: >
      You are a meticulous code reviewer. Identify bugs, security issues,
      performance concerns, and unclear design choices. Be precise and constructive.
```

Then switch to it with:

```text
/personality codereviewer
```

## Recommended workflow

A strong default setup is:

1. Keep a thoughtful global `SOUL.md` in `~/.apollo/SOUL.md`
2. Put project instructions in `AGENTS.md`
3. Use `/personality` only when you want a temporary mode shift

That gives you:
- a stable voice
- project-specific behavior where it belongs
- temporary control when needed

## How personality interacts with the full prompt

At a high level, the prompt stack includes:
1. default Apollo identity
2. memory/user context
3. skills guidance
4. context files such as `AGENTS.md`, `.cursorrules`, and global `SOUL.md`
5. platform-specific formatting hints
6. optional system-prompt overlays such as `/personality`

So `SOUL.md` is important, but it is one layer in a broader system.

## CLI appearance vs conversational personality

Conversational personality and CLI appearance are separate:

- `SOUL.md`, `agent.system_prompt`, and `/personality` affect how Apollo speaks
- `display.skin` and `/skin` affect how Apollo looks in the terminal

For terminal appearance, see [Skins & Themes](./skins.md).
